# Overview and Motivation
Universal apps are mobile / web apps. Intergalactic apps are mobile / web / desktop apps.
This project aims to be a well designed and maintained seed for an intergalactic (native mobile, web, desktop) app based on react native web, redux and typescript.

# What is this good for?
There are several similar seeds out there, but non with the project scope and goals we have in mind.
Have a well designed and maintained seed for intergalactic apps is useful for many kinds of applications across many verticals and can drastically reduce boilerplate code and encourages reuse of software components across different kind of packaging and execution environments.

## Project Goals
We aim to provide a generic starter seed for building a modern, universal app with the following properties:
- 100% sharing of app components (business logic) between all platforms
- 100% sharing of platform services and assets management between all platform
- Native iOS and Android look-and-feel
- Reuse of all UI components and layout across all platforms
- Use one main programming language for all platforms - Typescript to the rescue

## Architectural Directions
